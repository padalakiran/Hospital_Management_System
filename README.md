**2. java.sql.DriverManager:-** is used for class that manages a list of database drivers. It is part of the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API, which provides a standard interface for connecting to and interacting with databases.</br>
**3. java.sql.PreparedStatement:-** This class represents a precompiled SQL statement. It extends the java.sql.Statement interface and is used to execute parameterized SQL queries against a database. PreparedStatement objects are preferred over Statement objects when you need to execute the same SQL statement multiple times with different parameters, as they provide better performance and security through parameterized queries.</br>
**4. java.sql.ResultSet:-** This interface represents the result set of a database query. It provides methods for traversing the rows of the result set, accessing column values, and performing various operations on the data retrieved from the database. ResultSet objects are typically obtained by executing SQL queries using Statement or PreparedStatement objects.</br>
**5. java.util.Scanner:-** This class is used for parsing primitive types and strings from input streams (including text files, network connections, and other input sources) using regular expressions.
